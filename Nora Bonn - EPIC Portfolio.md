## About Me
* I orginally got into computer science back in 2022 because my older brother decided to go to college for it. After that I fell in love with working on computers and have been doing my best to learn more ever since.
* In the fall of 2022 I began my journey by learning python. It wasn't until the summer of 2023 that I decided to try learning HTML as well. When I came to school in the fall I had decided to take a plethora of computer science classes. 4 focused on cybersecurity and IT that each come with the chance to take their accompanying exams, A+, Network+, Linux+, and Security+. I have spent a lot of time studying for these exams and plan to take both the A+ and Network+ exams soon. I have proficency in Linux based programs and love learning more about security and the internet. As well as learning new languages.
### Strengths
- Strong proficiency in troubleshooting allowing me to figure out why many issues may be occuring.
- Research and learning new tools efficently.
- Colaboration with others in the same field.
- Communications with those outside of computer science field.
### Goals
- Currently I am working on understanding how hardware and code interact with eachother better.

	 - This project was made to log the temperature of small screenless devices and warn the user if the device heats up too much to ensure that they have time to take appropriate action.
	- Through this project I learned how to work with a device that had very minimal documentation as well as inegrating that new device with other skills I had previously learned to get the intended result.
