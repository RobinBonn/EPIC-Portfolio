## About Me
* I orginally got into computer science back in 2022 because my older brother decided to go to college for it. After that I fell in love with working on computers and have been doing my best to learn more ever since.
* In the fall of 2022 I began my journey by learning python. It wasn't until the summer of 2023 that I decided to try learning HTML as well. When I came to school in the fall I had decided to take a plethora of computer science classes. 4 focused on cybersecurity and IT that each come with the chance to take their accompanying exams, A+, Network+, Linux+, and Security+. I have spent a lot of time studying for these exams and plan to take both the A+ and Network+ exams soon.
