## About Me
* I originally got into computer science back in 2022 because my older brother decided to go to college for it. After that I fell in love with working on computers and have been doing my best to learn more ever since.
* In the fall of 2022 I began my journey by learning python. It wasn't until the summer of 2023 that I decided to try learning HTML as well. When I came to school in the fall I had decided to take a plethora of computer science classes. 4 focused on cybersecurity and IT that each come with the chance to take their accompanying exams, A+, Network+, Linux+, and Security+. I have spent a lot of time studying for these exams and plan to take both the A+ and Network+ exams soon. I have proficiency in Linux based programs and love learning more about security and the internet. As well as learning new languages.
### Strengths
- Strong proficiency in troubleshooting allows me to figure out why many issues may be occuring.
- Research and learn new tools efficiently.
- Collaboration with others in the same field.
- Communications with those outside of the computer science field.
### Goals
- Currently I am working on understanding how hardware and code interact with each other better.

## EPIC Experience

### Pi's and Python
* In this course we began with an introduction to Linux, the operating system we would be using for the rest of the year through a challenge called "Over the Wire: Bandit". Then we began to work on our Python skills with the Harvard CS50 course to build a strong foundation to work with our raspberry pis. During this time many of us collaborated and consulted one another when running into issues allowing us to get used to working together on a coding project. As I had learned python before the start of this class, this time period allowed me to get used to explaining the work I had done to someone with less knowledge on python contributing quite a bit to my current communication skill in that sector. After this we moved on to working with the Raspberry Pis. This not only taught me how to research when using a new piece of technology but also, how hardware and software work together allowing me to cement more of my fundamental knowledge.

## Projects:
-  Scourgify - *link to your repo*
    - Describe the project and its purpose
    - Describe what skills you used and what you learned during this project
- Final Project - *[link](https://github.com/RobinBonn/finalProject)*
     - This project was made to log the temperature of small screenless devices and warn the user if the device heats up too much to ensure that they have time to take appropriate action.
    - Through this project I learned how to work with a device that had very minimal documentation as well as integrating that new device with other skills I had previously learned to get the intended result.
