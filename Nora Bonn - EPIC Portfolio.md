## About Me
* I orginally got into computer science back in 2022 because my older brother decided to go to college for it. After that I fell in love with working on computers and have been doing my best to learn more ever since.
* In the fall of 2022 I began my journey by learning python. It wasn't until the summer of 2023 that I decided to try learning HTML as well. When I came to school in the fall I had decided to take a plethora of computer science classes. 4 focused on cybersecurity and IT that each come with the chance to take their accompanying exams, A+, Network+, Linux+, and Security+. I have spent a lot of time studying for these exams and plan to take both the A+ and Network+ exams soon. I have proficency in Linux based programs and love learning more about security and the internet. As well as learning new languages.
### Strengths
- I have a strong proficiency in troubleshooting allowing me to figure out why many issues may be occuring.
- I also have a strength in research and learning new tools efficently.
- 
### Goals
- Currently I am working on understanding how hardware and code interact with eachother better.
